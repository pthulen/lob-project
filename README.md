## Lob dashboard feature project

The goal of the project was to create a filtered address list for dashboard users.
The addresses are gathered from the Lob test API.

This project was built using Node.js and Express.js for the backend to handle the API request without exposing the API key in the frontend.

The frontend was built with React.js 

To run the project locally complete the following steps:
- Clone the repository.
- Change into the directory and enter the following to install dependencies:
`npm install`
- A dev.js file will need to be created in the config folder with a authorization key for the Lob API
- In the main directory run the following script to start up the backend server and frontend 
`npm run dev`
